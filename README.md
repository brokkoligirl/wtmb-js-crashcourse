<h4>FoodSnobs</h4>

A platform for food snobs to 
<ul><li>make Reservations, </li>
<li>create ics files for approved reservations,</li>
<li>visit & rate Restaurants 
(on a scale of 1-10),</li>
<li>attend FoodEvents (or cancel attendance),</li> 
<li>and tag 
restaurants they've been to.</li></ul>

Restaurants can <ul>
<li>approve or deny reservation requests,</li> 
<li>host FoodEvents </li>
<li>and invite their most loyal patrons to those events.</li></ul>

The Rating, Reservation, and FoodEvent classes don't have methods as 
they are "relationship objects". FoodSnobs and Restaurants create
instances of them in their interactions with each other to store and update 
information that describe their relationship.
